        Over the next decade, experts predict that AI will play an even bigger role
        in fields such as healthcare, education, and manufacturing. This growth will

        experiences across industries.

        While AI brings countless opportunities, it also raises ethical and security
        concerns. Ensuring transparency, fairness, and safe data practices will be
        essential as AI systems become more powerful and widely used.
